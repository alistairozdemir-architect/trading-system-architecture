# Engineering Evidence

This document provides concrete evidence of the engineering capabilities and infrastructure implemented in this project.

The goal is not to expose proprietary algorithms or internal intellectual property, but to demonstrate the engineering discipline, reliability mechanisms, and system architecture practices used in the development of this system.

---

# 1. Continuous Integration Infrastructure

The project includes a fully automated CI pipeline designed to validate system integrity on every push.

The pipeline performs the following operations:

• Docker image build  
• Container startup  
• Environment variable injection  
• Database initialization  
• Application boot validation  
• API readiness verification

This ensures that the system is continuously validated and deployable.

Key properties:

- Infrastructure reproducibility
- Automated environment validation
- Deployment safety checks
- Infrastructure failure detection before runtime

This pipeline verifies that the entire stack can be built and executed automatically from a clean environment.

# 2. Containerized System Architecture

The system is designed to run inside isolated containers.

Containerization ensures:

- deterministic runtime environments
- reproducible deployments
- environment isolation
- simplified operational deployment

The container boot process validates:

1. environment configuration
2. database connectivity
3. schema availability
4. application readiness

If any of these steps fail, the application aborts startup immediately.

This fail-fast design prevents partially functioning deployments.

---

# 3. Database Migration System

The project uses versioned database migrations.

Schema changes are managed through a migration system that guarantees:

- deterministic schema evolution
- environment consistency
- safe database upgrades
- rollback capability

Every database change is represented as a migration revision, ensuring the system can be recreated from an empty database using migration history.

---

# 4. Infrastructure Fail-Fast Validation

At application startup the system performs infrastructure validation.

The application checks:

- database connectivity
- required tables
- schema integrity
- configuration requirements

If the system detects a missing dependency or misconfiguration, startup is aborted immediately.

This ensures that the system never runs in a partially configured state.

---

# 5. Idempotent Event Ingestion Design

The event ingestion layer implements idempotent request handling.

This prevents duplicated data when the same request is submitted multiple times.

Mechanism:

- idempotency keys
- duplicate detection
- safe re-submission handling

This design is commonly used in financial infrastructure and distributed systems where network retries are possible.

---

# 6. Deterministic Event Ordering

The system processes events using deterministic ordering logic.

Events are sorted using multiple timestamp dimensions to ensure stable and reproducible event chains.

This prevents inconsistencies caused by ingestion delays or asynchronous event arrival.

The result is a consistent reconstruction of trading event sequences.

---

# 7. Data Integrity Protection

Multiple safeguards are implemented to protect data integrity:

- database constraints
- duplicate prevention logic
- idempotent request handling
- schema validation
- runtime startup checks

These mechanisms reduce the risk of corrupted event chains or inconsistent state.

---

# 8. Operational Reliability Focus

The project emphasizes reliability and operational safety.

Engineering priorities include:

- deterministic infrastructure
- reproducible builds
- safe startup validation
- migration-based schema control
- containerized deployment

This approach reflects infrastructure practices commonly used in production-grade systems.
